\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we have addressed the problem of providing secure
mutual authentication for the SSH protocol, maintaining full backwards
compatibility with existing server/client infrastructures as a primary
design principle. Leveraging the unique flexibility of SFE to compute
arbitrary hash functions within the protocol, we constructed a
protocol that provides an identical set of security guarantees as
previous work in the area, while remaining suitable as a ``drop-in''
authentication module on nearly all existing servers. Furthermore, we
demonstrated that a conservative set of optimizations to the protocol
made it practical for common use from a performance standpoint. In the
future, we intend to study further optimizations to certain parts of
the protocol that improve performance without sacrificing security, as
well as additional applications that could benefit from our basic
technique.
