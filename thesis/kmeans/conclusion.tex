\section{Conclusion}

We presented two privacy-preserving $k$-means algorithms. We also
implemented these algorithm and performed a thorough evaluations of
our algorithms. There are several avenues for further research. We
want to perform further optimizations to our tool to reduce the
execution and bandwidth overheads. We want to explore
privacy-preserving versions of other clustering algorithms. We are
particularly interested in hierarchical clustering algorithms.
