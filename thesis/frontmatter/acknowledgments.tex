%\section*{Acknowledgments}

Many thanks are in order to people who have taught, encouraged, and
inspired me. My parents, Paul and Claudia, always encouraged
me to develop and reach my potential. My wife Gina has put up with
many long Wisconsin winters during my graduate pursuits. My son Mathis
is an inspiration every time he smiles and says {}``Daddy!''.

I would especially like to thank my advisor, Somesh Jha, for all his
good ideas and advice. Professors Tom Reps and Bart Miller from the
WiSA project were early inspirations to me in my graduate career.
I would like to thank all of my paper co-authors, Dan Boneh, Mihai
Christodorescu, Matt Fredrikson, Jon Giffin, Eu-Jin Goh, Patrick McDaniel,
Shai Rubin, Vitaly Shmatikov, and Hao Wang, who have taught
me many things and provided endless discussions of ideas. 
I am forever indebted to my thesis committee.
%Eric Bach, Suman Banerjee, Somesh Jha, Karu.
I'm sure I have overlooked many other people who have helped to inspire
or discuss ideas.

Thanks to everyone who has been a part of my life in some way during
my grad student years. I couldn't have done it alone.
