\begin{proof}
%[{\it Proof Sketch for Claim~\ref{claim:protocol2secure}}]
The full proof is very similar for that in
Claim~\ref{claim:protocol1secure}, and we provide only a sketch. The
case when Alice is corrupt is identical to that in
Claim~\ref{claim:protocol1secure}. We briefly discuss why the proof is
also almost identical in the case when Bob is corrupt. The main
observation is that the simulator $\simu$ builds the simulated garbled
OBDD in the same way as in Claim~\ref{claim:protocol1secure} because
there is no difference in how Protocol 2 requires Bob to traverse the
garbled nodes given the same level keys. Therefore, the hybrid
distributions are defined the same way and the rest of the proof
follows.
