\section{Edit Distance between Two Strings}
\label{sec:edit-distance}


Let $\alpha$ and $\beta$ be two strings over an alphabet $\Sigma$.
Let the lengths of the two strings $\alpha$ and $\beta$ (denoted by $ \mid
\alpha \mid $ and $ \mid \beta \mid $) be $n$ and $m$, respectively. The
edit-distance between the two strings $\alpha$ and $\beta$ (denoted by
$\delta (\alpha,\beta)$) is the minimum number of edit operations
({\sf delete}, {\sf insert}, and {\sf replace}) needed to transform
$\alpha$ into $\beta$. We will describe a dynamic programming
algorithm to compute $\delta (\alpha,\beta)$, which executes in time
$O(nm)$. The description of the algorithm for computing edit-distance
is based on the discussion in~\cite{Gusfield}.

Given a
string $\alpha$, let $\alpha [1 \cdots i]$ denote the first $i$
characters of $\alpha$.  The dynamic programming algorithm maintains a
$(n+1) \times (m+1)$ matrix $D(0 \cdots n, 0 \cdots m)$, where
$D(i,j)$ is the edit distance between $\alpha [1 \cdots i]$ and $\beta
[1 \cdots j]$.


For the
base case, we have the following:
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eqn:base-case}
D(i,0) & = & i \;\; , \; 0 \leq i \leq n \\
D(0,j) & = & j \;\; , \; 0 \leq j \leq m
\end{eqnarray}
Next we describe a recursive relationship between the value $D(i,j)$ 
and the entries of $D$ with indices smaller than $i$ and $j$.
The $(i,j)$-th entry $D(i,j)$ of the matrix is computed as follows:
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eqn:recursive}
D(i,j) & = & \mbox{min} [ D(i-1,j) + 1, D(i,j-1)+1, \nonumber \\
       &  & D(i-1,j-1)+t(i,j) ]
\end{eqnarray}
where $t(i,j)$ is defined to have value $1$ if $\alpha (i) \not= \beta (j)$, and
has value $0$ if $\alpha (i) = \beta (j)$. The $i$-th character of a string $\alpha$
is denoted by $\alpha (i)$. The entire algorithm for computing edit distance is shown
in Figure~\ref{fig:edit-distance-alg}.

\begin{itemize}

\item Compute $D(i,0)$ and $D(0,j)$ for $1 \leq i \leq n$ and $1 \leq j \leq m$ using
equation~\ref{eqn:base-case}.

\item Compute $D(i,j)$ for $1 \leq i \leq n$ and $1 \leq j \leq m$ in row major order
using equation~\ref{eqn:recursive}. In other words, we first compute all entries for
row $1$, then row $2$, and so on.

\item The edit distance $\delta(\alpha,\beta)$ is equal to $D(n,m)$.
