%\section{Proof of Lemma~\ref{lemma:circuit}}
\label{appendix:lemma}

The proof is by simultaneous induction on $l$ and $w$. For $l=1$ and
$w=1$ the results follows using the following recursive relationship:
\begin{eqnarray*}
D(i,j) & = & \mbox{min} [ D(i-1,j) + 1, D(i,j-1)+1, D(i-1,j-1)+t(i,j) ]
\end{eqnarray*}
The induction step is tedious but simple. Assume that the result is true for all $l'$ and $w'$ such that $l' \leq l$ and
$w' \leq w$.  We will prove the result that for $l+1$ and $w$. Recall that
we have to prove that $D(i,j)$, can be expressed as a function of ${\it
bottom}(D(i,j),l+1,w)$, ${\it left}(D(i,j),l+1,w)$, $ \alpha [ i-w+1
\cdots i ]$, and $\beta [ j-l \cdots j]$.  The following three statements are true
by induction hypothesis:
\begin{itemize}
\item $D(i-1,j)$ can be expressed as a function of ${\it
bottom}(D(i-1,j),l+1,w-1)$, ${\it left}(D(i,j),l+1,w-1)$, $ \alpha [ i-w+1
\cdots i-1 ]$, and $\beta [ j-l \cdots j]$

\item $D(i,j-1)$ can be expressed as a function of ${\it
bottom}(D(i,j-1),l,w)$, ${\it left}(D(i,j-1),l,w)$, $ \alpha [ i-w+1
\cdots i ]$, and $\beta [ j-l \cdots j-1]$

\item $D(i-1,j-1)$ can be expressed as a function of ${\it
bottom}(D(i-1,j-1),l,w-1)$, ${\it left}(D(i-1,j-1),l,w-1)$, $ \alpha [ i-w+1
\cdots i-1 ]$, and $\beta [ j-l \cdots j-1]$.
\end{itemize}
Notice that $D(i,j)$
can be expressed in terms of $D(i-1,j)$, $D(i,j-1)$, $D(i-1,j-1)$, 
$\alpha[i]$,  and $\beta[j]$. Now the result is clear by combining the
the four statements mentioned above. Similarly, we can prove that $D(i,j)$, can be expressed as a function of ${\it
bottom}(D(i,j),l,w+1)$, ${\it left}(D(i,j),l,w+1)$, $ \alpha [ i-w
\cdots i ]$, and $\beta [ j-l+1 \cdots j]$. $\Box$
