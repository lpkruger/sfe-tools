Many basic tasks in computational biology involve operations on individual
DNA and protein sequences.  These sequences, even when anonymized,
are highly vulnerable to re-identification attacks and may reveal highly
sensitive information about individuals.

We present practical, privacy-preserving implementations of fundamental
genomic computations, such as calculating the edit distance and
Smith-Waterman similarity scores between two sequences.  Our techniques
are both cryptographically secure, and significantly more efficient
than generic secure multi-party computation.  We evaluate our prototype
implementation on sequences from the Pfam database of protein families,
and demonstrate that its performance is sufficient for solving real-world
sequence-alignment and related problems in a privacy-preserving manner.

Furthermore, our techniques have applications beyond computational
biology.  They can be used to obtain efficient, privacy-preserving
implementations for many dynamic programming algorithms over distributed
datasets.
