\section{Conclusion}

We presented several privacy-preserving protocols for computing on genome
data, including calculating the edit distance between genome sequences
and computing Smith-Waterman similarity scores.  We evaluated our
implementation on real problem instances involving alignment of protein
sequences, and demonstrated that its performance is practical even for
problems instances of substantial size.  Our techniques generalize to
other dynamic programming algorithms, and we expect that they will find
application in other contexts, \eg, in hierarchical clustering algorithms
which use edit distance as the metric.
