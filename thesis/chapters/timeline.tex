\subsection{Summer 2007}
\begin{itemize}
\item Secure authentication in SSH (see section \ref{sub:SPAKA-using-SFE})

\begin{itemize}
\item define protocol extension
\item implement classic SPAKA 
\item implement SFE SPAKA
\item benchmark and compare
\end{itemize}
\item Target publication: Usenix Security 2008
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Fall 2007}
\begin{itemize}
\item Investigate optimizations of cryptographic primitives (see section
\ref{sub:Other-Optimizations})

\begin{itemize}
\item adapt standard oblivious transfer algorithms to use more efficient
representations, such as elliptic curve groups
\item evaluate modular square root oblivious transfer (see section \ref{sec:OT-SquareRoots})
\item investigate use of other kinds of functions for oblivious transfers
and homomorphic encryption
\end{itemize}
\item Target publication: TBD
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Winter/Spring 2008}
\begin{itemize}
\item Investigate use of other circuit representations (see section \ref{OBDD-section})

\begin{itemize}
\item evaluate which OBDD extensions are good candidates for secure protocols
\item implement compiler and protocols
\item performance measurements
\end{itemize}
\item Target publication: TBD
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Spring/Summer 2008}
\begin{itemize}
\item Investigate optimizations resulting from controlled leakage of information.
(see section \ref{sub:Other-Optimizations})

\begin{itemize}
\item Develop specification language to tag intermediate values as sensitive
or non-sensitive
\item Develop hybrid evaluation protocols that protect sensitive data but
avoid the overhead when evaluating non-sensitive computations
\item Implement and measure performance gains
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Fall/Winter 2008}
\begin{itemize}
\item Optimizing protocol compiler. (see section \ref{sub:An-Efficient-Framework})

\begin{itemize}
\item Define programming language for expressing secure computations

\begin{itemize}
\item Language will include direct support for common SFE techniques, such
as homomorphic encryption, and metadata for privacy levels
\end{itemize}
\item Implement compiler for this language into securely evaluable {}``machine
code''
\item Automatic optimizer will try different representations of the functions,
including OBDDs, Boolean circuits, and other ideas from my research,
and produce as efficient as a representation as possible
\item Implement protocol evaluation library, to make straightforward use
in ordinary applications.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Spring 2009}
\begin{itemize}
\item Write dissertation and graduate.
\end{itemize}
